# Vector-Angular-Spectrum-Model-for-light-travelling-in-scattering-medium
The vector angular spectrum can be used to simulate the transport and evolution of a vector light field through a scattering medium.
One can modify different scattering medium parameters and simulation conditions in the VAS.m file.

Step for a simulation:
1. Release all .m files in a same folder;
2. Modify the parameters and simulation conditions in VAS.m;
3. Run VAS.m and we can get the following two figures with default settings:
